Footnotes and Citations
==================

**footnote**

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently
   indented by at least 3 spaces.


If [#note]_ is the first footnote reference, it will show up as
"[1]".  We can refer to it again as [#note]_ and again see
"[1]".  We can also refer to it as note_ (an ordinary internal
hyperlink reference).

.. [#note] This is the footnote labeled "note".


**citation**

.. [CIT2002] Just like a footnote, except the label is textual.


**hyperlink ref**
